Given a 2D array intervals[][], where intervals[i] = [starti, endi]. Return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note: Two intervals are considered non-overlapping if the end time of one interval is less than or equal to the start time of the next interval.

Examples:

Input: intervals[][] = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [1, 3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1, 3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
Input: intervals[][] = [[1, 3], [1, 3], [1, 3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1, 3] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
Input: intervals[][] = [[1, 2], [5, 10], [18, 35], [40, 45]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All intervals are already non-overlapping.
