Problem Statement: Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

Examples
Input : nums = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0] , k = 3
Output : 10
Explanation : The maximum number of consecutive 1's are obtained only if we flip the 0's present at position 3, 4, 5 (0 base indexing).
The array after flipping becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0].
The number of consecutive 1's is 10.


Input : nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] , k = 3
Output : 9
Explanation : The underlines 1's are obtained by flipping 0's in the new array.
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1].
The number of consecutive 1's is 9.
